# Xpress

## Overview

**Xpress** is a web-based XML processor, allowing users to upload, parse, and query XML documents. It features a simple interface for XML parsing and offers basic XPath Query capabilities. The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring easy deployment and scalability.

## Features

- **XML Upload and Compressing**: Upload XML files to Compress them to a more compact form
- **XML Queries**: User can input queries in XPath format to query the uploaded XML document efficiently. The queries can be made in `O(logn)` time complexity where `n` is the number of leaf nodes present in the document. The syntax and semantic validation of the XPath query is handled by the application itself.

## Research Perspective
- The algorithm for the XML compression is inspired from the paper:
